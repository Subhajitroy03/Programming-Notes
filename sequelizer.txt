npx sequelize init    -> initialized a sequelize , create folders etc etc, run the command on the project folder (eg - src/)

npx sequelize db:create -> Creates the database mentioned in config.json() 

npx sequelize model:generate --name <name of model> --attributes <field1>:<datatype>,<field2>:<datatype>

Points to be noted:
1) There are two layers: Database label and javascipt label, the model is actually the javascipt label
Any changes to it will reflect the user input but the tables will not changes

2)The final change to table is in the hand of migration , finalize the model structure in migration 
and then we need to commit the change
Its basically version controlling of sql tables , you finalize a model and then you commit , if you do any other changes do in migration and then again commit
You can also go back / revert your changes

npx sequelize db:migrate --> runs the pending migration (basically commit)

npx sequelize db:migrate:undo -->  revert back your changes

npx sequelize db:migrate:undo:all --> revert back all your changes
